# ?info? About

###Hey!  
As I said on the [home](/home) page my name is <span style="color: var(--primary-color)">**Vano**</span> (<u>*notice color is changeable*</u>).  
My website is formatted with `.md` files and supports latex both inline, $e^x$ and display.  
$$\begin{equation}  
    S(\omega)=1.467 H_s^2 \frac{\omega_0^5}{\omega^6} \exp\Bigl[-3^{\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}}\Bigr]^2  
\end{equation}$$
Cool huh?  

#### Additionally  
The website additionally supports:  
- Live editing of the `.md` files.  
- Support for custom icons ?command?  
- Code hightlighting (**LaTeX** for this example):
```LaTeX
$$
\begin{equation}  
    S(\omega)=1.467 H_s^2 \frac{\omega_0^5}{\omega^6} \exp\Bigl[-3^{\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}}\Bigr]^2  
\end{equation}
$$
