# ?info? About

Hey!  
As I said on the [home](/home) page my name is Vano.     
My website is formatted with `.md` files and supports latex both inline, $e^x$ and display.

\begin{equation}
S(\omega)=1.467 H_s^2 \frac{\omega_0^5}{\omega^6} \exp\Bigl[-3^{\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}}\Bigr]^2
    \end{equation}

Cool huh?
